# Restaurant-name-generator

This project is a restaurant name generator built using the LLM (Large Language Model) based framework called langchain. It utilizes the power of OpenAI's language model to generate creative restaurant names and menu items based on various cuisines.

## Deployment

The project has been tested and deployed locally using Streamlit for the user interface. Users can select a cuisine of their choice, and the application generates a unique restaurant name along with a list of menu items using langchain's chain concept.
